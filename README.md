# Welcome to coding!
Today your going to write your first piece of code!
But first we need to install all the things to get started

## Step One
Lets install [VSCode](code.visualstudio.com)
To do this open up the link above and click on the correct download type for your operating system

| Operating System | Download File |
|--|--|
| Windows | exe |
| Mac | dmg |
| Linux | deb or rpm (You should know which one if your using linux) |

Now go through the installation process (This is different depending on your operating system)
|Operating System| Process |

| Windows | Open up the file you just downloaded and go through the steps on screen |
| Mac | Open up the file you just downloaded and follow the steps on screen |
| Linux | Use your package manager to install this file (Search up how to do this) |

Awesome now that you have installed VSCode you can now open it up

## Whats VSCode?
VSCode is a Intergrated Development Enviroment (IDE For Short) A IDE is a tool you can use to write and run your code we are using VSCode because it is the best one for beginners

## Lets get it set up!
VSCode is really easy to customize and add **Extensions** to make it even easier to code
So lets install a couple of extensions.

To do this follow the following steps:
 Click on the extensions tab (The one above the settings icon)
 It will bring up a menu for you to search into
 To install a extension you have to do the following:
- Type in **The extensions name**
- Click on the **Install** button
 Do this for the following extensions
----
- `ritwickdey.liveserver`
- `coenraads.bracket-pair-colorizer-2` 
- `ritwickdey.live-sass`
- `esbenp.prettier-vscode`
- `formulahendry.auto-rename-tag`
- `formulahendry.auto-close-tag`
---
Amazing! We now are ready to write some code!
- Click the top icon on your sidebar this is the **File Manager** 
- Click the **Open Folder** Button and make a new folder called **Coding** make another folder inside called **HTML** And one more inside the HTML folder **Hello World**
	 >  So thats Coding > HTML > Hello World
 - Now open the Hello World folder into VSCode
 - hover over the Hello World text on the sidebar you should see some icons hover over each one until you find the `New File` One
 - Click it and type in `index.html`
 - press enter and click on that new file
